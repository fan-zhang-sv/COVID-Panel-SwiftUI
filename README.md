# COVID Panel

This is an iOS app for COVID-19 data visualization, built with SwiftUI and UIKit. I designed and developed this app to help users get and analyze data easily on their iPhones.

Unfortunetely, Apple does not allow COVID related app to be uploaded by individual developer, thus, I am still looking for any research institution or CDC offcials, that wants to publish their data to users, to collaborate on this project.

If you would like to know more about this app, please contact me on: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fan-zhang-sv/)
